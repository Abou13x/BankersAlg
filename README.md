# BankersAlg
Bankerâ€™s algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum of their money is S. If a person applies for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that bank has and if the remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the account holders comes to withdraw their money then the bank can easily do it.
In other words, the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no longer satisfy the needs of all its customers. The bank would try to be in safe state always.

My code can be ran in visual studio code or any other C++ editor.

In this assignemnt, I had to Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances and snapshot at t0 of the system to determine if the system is in safe mode and if print the safe mode sequence

I used tow demension array alloc, max, and an array avail to recreate the system's snapshot in the code to determine with it is in safe mode
